# SP-Dynamic-obstacle-detection-for-autonomous-gokartsüèéÔ∏è

## Project Overview
This repository documents my semester project at ETH Zurich's Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), focused on developing a robust obstacle detection system for autonomous racing go-karts. The project introduces a novel approach using a dynamic occupancy grid in a local frame, enhancing reliability through localization independence.

*Note: The implementation code remains private within IDSC's repository.*
